To Do
=====

+ Overlap problem
	+ Create a program that solves genomic overlaps
		+ pandas
		+ vanilla python
	+ Test performance on synthetic data of various sizes
	+ Write a faster algorithm
+ Introns
	+ Read the Paper by Rose et al 2008
	+ Look at the at_ime_tissues.txt.gz file
	+ Re-implement the IMEter as described in the paper
	+ Run the IMEter on a bunch of introns
	+ Calculate the expression entropy of every gene
	+ Graph expression vs. max IMEter for each gene

Much of this will require discussion.
